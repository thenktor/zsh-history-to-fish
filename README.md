# Convert your ZSH history to Fish shell

This is a simple shell script to ease the migration from ZSH to Fish shell. It converts the ZSH history to Fish.

This is a shell rewrite of [rsalmei/zsh-history-to-fish](https://github.com/rsalmei/zsh-history-to-fish), because I dod not want to install Python for this small task.
